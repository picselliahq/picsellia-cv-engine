# ðŸ“Œ Picsellia CV Engine Documentation

Welcome to the **Picsellia CV Engine** documentation! ðŸš€

This project provides a set of **reusable steps** to build **processing and training pipelines** for computer vision tasks.
With **Pipeline CLI**, you can quickly initialize, test, and deploy your pipelines.

## Features
- **Dataset Processing**: Extract, process, and validate dataset versions.
- **Model Training**: Build and train deep learning models with structured pipelines.
- **Dataset Upload**: Upload processed datasets to **Picsellia**.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure dataset integrity before training.
- **Weights Extraction**: Manage and extract trained model weights.
- **CLI for Automation**: Use `pipeline-cli` to speed up pipeline creation & deployment.
